            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT cannot be improper, certainly, for one of your <hi>Clergy</hi> to make an Addreſs of this Nature to your Lordſhip, and upon a <hi>Religious Theme</hi> too.

            <p>Upon a <hi>Survey of all Churches in the World,</hi> I think, we of this Church and Nation, are as happy as any People under the Sun; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only in one thing, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Know, nor Value our own Happineſs: A <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and Spirit of Giddineſs, hath poſſeſſed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of late years, which makes our Heads turn round upon our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and our Hearts unquiet and diſcontented within us.

            <p>SInce I firſt engaged in this little Work, I made uſe of one Notion, which my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in it furniſh'd me with, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to Attack the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> with, <hi>viz.</hi> The general Conſent, and almoſt Univerſal Practice, not only of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but all the World, <hi>Jews, Gentiles, Mahometans, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> of all Sects, <hi>Proteſtants, Papists, Greeks, Armenians, Muſcovites, Mengrelians, Indians</hi> of <hi>S.

I firſt objected this to ſeveral private Members of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> Congregation; every one of which confeſſed ingenuouſly they could not Anſwer it, but referr'd it to one of their
<pb facs="tcp:64885:7"/>Teachers about 20 Miles diſtance from me: To whom at laſt I wrote very plainly and briefly, deſiring, in humble Terms, a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Argument, if it were poſſible. His Anſwer, which was prolix enough, was yet very unſatisfactory; he offered no reaſon to ſolve the Difficulty, tho I had urged it with ſome briskneſs, and backed it with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis, Quod ſemper, quod ab omnibus, quod ubi<expan>

This I wrote, and ſent to him, and have <hi>frequently</hi> called upon his <hi>friends</hi> for an anſwer, but have not received one Line from him to this day; and tho he hath, ſince that time, paſſed by, very near my Houſe, yet he did not ſo much as call upon me.

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſians</hi> hold, that <hi>Aboubeker, Omar</hi> and <hi>Oſman,</hi> were but ſo many Uſurpers of <hi>Aly;</hi> that <hi>Aly</hi> was the Lawful Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſucceeded him: that <hi>Aly</hi> was the firſt of the Twelve <hi>Imams,</hi> whom they much honour, and who ſucceeded one another; of whom the laſt called <hi>Mahomet-Nekedy-Sahabzemon</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Mr. of the times) was ſnatched out of the hands of thoſe who would have killed him, and tranſlated as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and that he will alſo come at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to force the world to embrace the Faith of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be his Leute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that he will marry.</p>
                     <p>This is the great point of difference between the <hi>Turks</hi> and them, <hi>M. de Thev.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Perſians</hi> will not eat what a Chriſtian hath touch'd, nor ſuffer a Chriſtian to come into their Coffee-houſes, or <hi>Bagnioes,</hi> accounting them <hi>Meg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, i. e.</hi> impure: They break a Pot wherein a Chriſtian hath Drunk.

               <p>They kneel down upon the ground, before a bench, or the like, and continue thus in all their Prayers in ſilence, as long as one might repeat a <hi>Pater-Noſter</hi> 30 or 40 times, and conclude their Prayers by repeating the word <hi>Amen</hi> ſeveral times; and this they do every day very Reverently, amongſt thoſe of their own Perſwaſion, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any Strangers, before noon, after noon, and at night when they go to bed; beſides ſome other times, as well in the day, morning and at night; they ſay, teach, nor have any other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er beſides <hi>Our Father.</hi> They do not look on the Salutation of the Angel to be a Prayer, nor the Apoſtle's Creed; and ſay that theſe were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not by Chriſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have drawn up a ſhort draught of the ſeven Articles concerning the Godhead, and as many concerning the Human Nature, the Ten Commandmants, and the ſeven Works of Mercy, which they ſay and teach, and boaſt much of them,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64885:165"/>and readily offer themſelves to Anſwer to any one that demands of them a reaſon of their Faith. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſet themſelves down to Table, they bleſs it, ſaying, <hi>Bleſs the Lord. Lord have mercy upon us, Chriſt have mercy upon us; Lord have mercy upon us Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. After which, the Eldeſt of the Company ſaith, in the Vulgar Tongue, <hi>God who bleſſed the</hi> 5 <hi>barley Loaves and</hi> 2 <hi>Fiſhes in the Deſart before his Diſciples, bleſs this Table, and that which is upon it</hi> (and then make the ſign of the Croſs) <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Amen. And when they riſe from Table, after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or Supper, they give Thanks thus, the Eldeſt in the Vulgar Tongue repeating the Doxology, ſet down in the Revelation, <hi>Bleſſing and Glory and Wiſdom and Thanksgiving, Honour, Power and Might, be aſcribed to God alone, for ever and ever,</hi> Amen. And then adds, <hi>God render a good reward, and a plentiful return to all thoſe who are our Benefactors; and the God who hath given us Corporal food, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us alſo the Life of his Spirit; and God be with us, and we with him always.</hi> Amen. Alſo when they bleſs the Table, and when they return Thanks, they fold their Hands together, and lift them up towards Heaven. And after Dinner, and they have returned Thanks and Prayed, as before, they Preach, Teach, and Exhort according to their way and Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>It were needleſs to make inſtances of Sincerity or Purity in Chriſtians, their Holy Lives, their reſplendent Graces, their great and extraordinary Sufferings being an abundant proof thereof, even in the Judgments (ſometimes) of their Enemies; who by this means have been Converted and brought over, not only to a good Opinion of the Perſons, but the Religion too. And tho it muſt be confeſſed, that all which hath gliſtered amongſt them, was not pure Gold; yet neither was all paint and diſſimulation. The Letters in ſome are too plain and Capital to be miſconſtrued to Hypocriſy: And tho the Infirmities of Nature have ſometimes ſhaded the brightneſs of their Vertues; yet I doubt not, but in many the Heart (as in the Caſe of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>) hath been preſerved intire and inviolate.</p>

                     <p>As to the Ceremony of Marriage, the Prieſt asks before Witneſſes, if they both conſent; then taking a little Water, he ſays a few Prayers over it; and

                     <p>Amongſt the <hi>Armenians</hi> the Mothers often agree upon Marriages for their Children, at two or three years old, ſometimes before they are Born, before either Party have ſeen each other, or the Fathers and Brothers know any thing of it: Upon the Fathers Approbation, the Mother of the boy, with 2 Old Women goes to the Houſe where the Mother of the Daughter Lives, and Preſent her with a Ring from the Boy; the Boy appears afterwards, and the Prieſt reads ſomething out of the Goſpel, as a bleſſing upon both Parties; after which they give him a ſum of Money, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Father of the Girl; this done, they preſent the Company with Drink: And this is called a Betrothing. After this giving of the Ring, tho it be 20 years after, before they are Married, the Boy is bound yearly upon <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> to ſend his Miſtreſs a New Suit of Clothes with ſuitable Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Three days before Marriage, the Boy's Parents prepare a Feaſt, and a New Suit of Cloths for the Girl; at length the Boy on one Horſe, and the Girl on another, ſumptuouſly Harneſſed, with Bridles and Saddles of Gold and Silver, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

Two Men walk on either ſide the Horſes; and if they are Children of 3 or 4 years old, there are 3 or 4 Men to hold them in the Saddle; for ſo young they Marry: A great Train of People follow, with Tapers in their Hands, as if going in Proceſſion; Drums, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Haut-boys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Attending to the Church-door: When alighted, the Bride-groom and Bride ſtill holding the Girdle in their Hands, advance to the Foot of the Altar, where they lean Forehead to Forehead; the Prieſt laying his <hi>Bible</hi> on their Heads, inſtead of a Desk, a weight ſufficiently heavy, as being a thick ponderous <hi>Folio:</hi> Then the Miniſter, commonly a Biſhop or Arch-biſhop, reads the Service, very much like ours, demanding, <hi>Wilt thou have ſuch a one to thy Wife? To thy Husband?</hi> To which they Anſwer with a Nod of the Head. After the Matrimonial Benediction they hear Maſs, and ſo return to the Daughter's Habitation, where the Nuptials laſt three days, the Women Drinking more than the Men. The Man goes to bed firſt, the Woman pulling off his Breeches, tho ſhe doth not lay aſide her Veil till the Candle is out. Let it be what time of the year it will, the Woman riſes before day. So that there be ſome <hi>Armenians,</hi> that in 10 years after, they are Married, never ſaw their Wives Faces, nor never heard them ſpeak. For tho her Husband may ſpeak to her, and all the reſt of her Kindred, yet ſhe never anſwers but with a nod. The Women never

Their charge was to ſweep and make clean the Temple, and every Morning to prepare Meat for the Idol and his Miniſters, of the Alms the Religious gathered. The Food they prepared for the Idol was of ſmall Loaves, in the form of Hands and Feet, as of March-pane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Virgins had their Hair cut, and then let it grow for a certain time, they roſe at Midnight to the Idol's Mattins, which they daily celebrated, performing the ſame Exerciſes which the Religious did. They had their Abbeſſes, who employed them to make Cloth of divers faſhions, for the Ornaments of their Gods and Temples. Their ordinary Habit was all white, without any work or colour. They did their Penance at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſacrificing and wounding themſelves, and piercing the tops of their Ears, laying the Blood
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:64885:296"/>which iſſued forth on their Cheeks, and after bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in a Pool which was in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.

                     <p>The other Cloyſter was of Young Men, of 18 or 20 Years old, with Crowns ſhaven, living poorly and chaſtly, miniſtring to the Prieſts Incenſe, Lights and Garments, ſweeping the Holy Place, bringing Wood for a continual Fire that ſtill burned before the Altar. Beſides theſe, there were other little Boys, that decked the Temple with Boughs, Roſes and Reeds, gave the Prieſts Water to waſh, Razours for Sacrificing, and went with ſuch as begged Alms, to carry it; When they came where Women were, they carried their eyes to the ground, not daring to behold them.

                     <p>There might not above 50 live thus together; they aroſe at Midnight, and ſounded the Trumpet to awaken the People.

S. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and publiſhing the Life of <hi>S. Antony,</hi> many in <hi>Italy</hi> embraced that kind of Life. Their Employment was Prayer, Reading, and manual Labour; Biſhops ſometimes drew <hi>Monks</hi> into the Clergy; but ordinarily they were but part of the people, and their Revenues only what they got by Labour, and a ſhare in the Poor's Alms; and people gave them private Alms, that they might pray to God for them. They came at firſt to the Pariſh-Church, afterwards were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Prieſt of their own. Hence came their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Churches, the <hi>Monks</hi> performing all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Functions; Hence the Diſputes between <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> hence Deeds of Ceſſions, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Charters, <hi>&amp;c.
